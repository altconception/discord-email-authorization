# discord-email-authorization
Discord bot that authorizes users based on provided email addresses.

Still very much a work in progress, I plan to get this done sooner rather than later, but wanted to post it on GitHub first anyways.

Currently I need to work out the issues with the discord API and reading .csv files.
